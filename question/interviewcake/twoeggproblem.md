#### A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking.

If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped from that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again.

Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking, with as few drops as possible.

```java
public class Solution {

    public static String myFunction(String arg) {

        // write the body of your function here
        

        return "running with " + arg;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // run your function through some test cases here
        // remember: debugging is half the battle!
        String testInput = "test input";
        System.out.println(myFunction(testInput));
    }
}
```
